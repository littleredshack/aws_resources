‚è∫ Security Audit Summary for stable-dev

  ‚úÖ Good Security Practices Found:

  1. SSH Security:
    - Password authentication disabled
    - Root login restricted (without-password only)
    - Public key authentication enabled
    - Empty passwords not permitted
    - SSH keys have proper permissions (600 for private keys)
  2. User Security:
    - Only 2 users with shell access (root and ubuntu)
    - Ubuntu user password is locked (L status)
    - Ubuntu user has sudo privileges
  3. File Permissions:
    - SSH host keys properly secured (600 permissions)
    - .ssh directory and authorized_keys have correct permissions
  4. Services:
    - Minimal services running
    - VS Code tunnel service is active and running
    - Unattended upgrades enabled for automatic security updates

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Concerns:

  1. Firewall is DISABLED - This is the biggest security risk. UFW is inactive, leaving all ports unfiltered.
  2. Only SSH port (22) is exposed to the network, which is good, but without a firewall, any service could potentially be exposed.
  3. One package needs updating (linux-tools-common) - though it's minor.

  üîí Recommendations (without making changes):

  1. Enable UFW firewall with rules allowing only SSH (port 22)
  2. Consider fail2ban for SSH brute force protection
  3. Run the pending system update
  4. Monitor VS Code tunnel access - ensure you're using strong authentication for the tunnel itself

  The server has decent baseline security for SSH access, but the disabled firewall is a significant vulnerability that should be addressed.

‚è∫ AWS Security Groups vs Host Firewall

   AWS Security Groups acting as a virtual firewall at the network level. Let me check your current AWS security setup:

  Best Practice: Use BOTH (Defense in Depth)

  Here's why:

  1. AWS Security Groups (Network-level):
    - First line of defense
    - Blocks traffic before it reaches your server
    - Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)
    - Can't protect against threats from within the VPC
    - If misconfigured, your server is exposed
  2. Host Firewall (UFW) (Host-level):
    - Second line of defense
    - Protects against lateral movement if another instance in your VPC is compromised
    - Protects if Security Group is accidentally misconfigured
    - Can implement more granular rules (rate limiting, etc.)
    - Useful for localhost restrictions

  For your VS Code tunnel setup:

  Since you're only exposing SSH and VS Code tunnels work through SSH, you're in good shape. AWS Security Groups alone are probably sufficient for your use case, but enabling UFW adds minimal overhead and provides extra protection.

  Minimum recommendation: Stick with AWS Security Groups if they're properly configured to only allow SSH (port 22) from your IP addresses.

  Better recommendation: Enable both for defense-in-depth, especially if this server will contain sensitive code or data.

  üéØ Assessment:

  Your AWS security is well-configured. The security group is doing exactly what a host firewall would do - only allowing SSH from a specific IP address.

  Recommendation:

  For your use case (VS Code tunnel for remote development), AWS Security Groups alone are sufficient because:

  1. ‚úÖ Only SSH is allowed inbound
  2. ‚úÖ Restricted to a single source IP
  3. ‚úÖ VS Code tunnels work through SSH
  4. ‚úÖ No other services need external access

  Optional additions for extra security:
  - Enable UFW as backup (defense in depth)
  - Consider AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for SSH access (eliminates need for public IP)
  - Add CloudWatch monitoring for SSH login attempts

  Your current setup is secure for its purpose. The main thing to watch: if your IP address changes (ISP change, travel, etc.), you'll need to update the security group rule.
