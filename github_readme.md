# EC2 + VS Code Remote Setup (Tested & Working)

**A reliable, battle-tested solution for EC2 development with VS Code tunnels - no more Remote-SSH crashes!**

## 🚀 What This Provides

- **Stable EC2 instances** that won't crash during development
- **VS Code Tunnels** for browser-based development (much more reliable than Remote-SSH)  
- **Phased setup approach** with verification at each step
- **Automatic SSH configuration** for emergency/admin access
- **Complete resource cleanup** when removing instances
- **IP-restricted security** (only your IP can access)

## ⚡ Why This Works (Lessons Learned)

**❌ What Crashes Instances:**
- **VS Code Remote-SSH** on t2.micro - consistently crashes after 2-3 hours
- **Heavy user data scripts** - cause dpkg errors and package conflicts during boot
- **Auto-installing Docker/Node.js** - overwhelms 1GB RAM instances
- **AWS SSM proxy setup** - complex, unreliable, frequent timeouts

**✅ What Actually Works:**
- **VS Code Tunnels** - browser-based, stable, full functionality
- **Minimal user data** - only essential tools (git, vim, htop), fast reliable boot
- **Post-creation setup** - install tools after basic connectivity verified
- **Phased verification** - test each step before proceeding, catch failures early

**🧪 Battle-Tested Evidence:**
- **GitHub issues** - Remote-SSH problems documented since 2020, still unresolved
- **Real console logs** - dpkg errors during heavy installations
- **Actual testing** - tried SSM, AWS Toolkit, heavy installs - all failed
- **Working solution** - tunnels provide stable development for hours/days

## 📖 What We Tried That Failed

**Remote-SSH Approach:**
- ✅ Easy initial setup
- ❌ Crashes instances after hours of use
- ❌ Difficult to troubleshoot crashes
- ❌ Loses work when instance dies

**SSM (Systems Manager) Approach:**
- ✅ "More secure" (marketing claim)
- ❌ Complex proxy configuration
- ❌ Frequent connection failures  
- ❌ Parameter format issues
- ❌ Hard to debug when broken

**AWS Toolkit Integration:**
- ✅ Built-in to VS Code
- ❌ Breaks existing SSH configs
- ❌ No way to refuse config changes
- ❌ Buggy ec2_connect script

**Heavy User Data Installation:**
- ✅ Everything ready at boot
- ❌ Package conflicts during install
- ❌ Memory exhaustion on t2.micro
- ❌ Instance corruption requiring rebuild

## 🏃‍♂️ Complete Setup Process

**1. Create instance:**
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
./ec2_ssh_only_setup_v2.sh --region eu-west-1 --my-ip YOUR_IP --name "my-dev"
```

**2. Install development tools with persistent tunnel:**
```bash
ssh my-dev

# Install latest Node.js (required for modern tools)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install VS Code
sudo snap install code --classic

# Install Claude CLI (optional)
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude configure  # Set your Anthropic API key

# Set up persistent tunnel service
./setup_tunnel_service.sh my-dev
```

**3. Alternative - Full automatic setup:**
```bash
# Everything automated in one command (includes persistent tunnel)
./ec2_ssh_only_setup_v2.sh --region eu-west-1 --my-ip YOUR_IP --name "dev-server" --key-name "dev-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)" --post-install
```

**4. Open tunnel URL in browser:**
- Full VS Code interface
- Integrated terminal
- No crashes, no Remote-SSH issues

## 🔧 Management & Monitoring

```bash
# List instances
./list_ec2_instances.sh eu-west-1

# Monitor instance health (prevent crashes)
./monitor_instance.sh stable-dev

# Complete cleanup when done
./remove_ec2_instances.sh --region eu-west-1 i-instance-id

# List all AWS resources
./list_all_aws_resources.sh eu-west-1
```

## 🧪 Phased Setup Approach

**🎯 PHASE 1: Create Instance**
- Minimal Ubuntu 22.04 with essential tools only
- No heavy packages that cause conflicts

**🔧 PHASE 2: Configure SSH**  
- Automatic SSH config generation
- Backup of existing config

**🧪 PHASE 3: Test SSH (CRITICAL)**
- Verifies connectivity before proceeding
- Stops if SSH fails - no broken setups

**🚀 PHASE 4: Install VS Code**
- Only after SSH verified working
- Uses snap for reliability

**🛠️ PHASE 5: Post-Install (Optional)**
- Node.js, Claude CLI, development tools
- Only with --post-install flag

**⚙️ PHASE 6: Persistent Tunnel**
- Systemd service for auto-start
- Survives reboots, auto-restarts

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **SSH access only from your IP** - automatically configured
- ✅ **No public services** except SSH on port 22
- ✅ **Key-based authentication** - no passwords
- ✅ **Automatic security group cleanup** - no orphaned resources
- ✅ **Encrypted tunnel access** - authenticated via Microsoft/GitHub

## 🛠️ Key Files & Recovery

**Local Files (Auto-generated):**
- `~/.ssh/config` - SSH connection details
- `~/ssh-key-YYYYMMDDHHMM.pem` - Private key for SSH
- `~/.ssh/config.backup.YYYYMMDDHHMM` - Automatic backups

**Recovery Scenarios:**
- **IP changed**: Update security group via AWS Console  
- **Lost key**: Connect via AWS Console, add new key
- **SSH config corrupted**: Restore from automatic backup

## 🐛 Common Issues

- **"Permission denied"** - Check IP: `curl ifconfig.me`, update security group
- **"Connection refused"** - Wait 2-3 minutes for instance boot
- **Tunnel auth fails** - Use incognito browser window
- **Instance crashes** - You probably used Remote-SSH (use tunnels instead!)

## 💰 Cost Information

**Free Tier Eligible:**
- t2.small: ~$17/month (much more reliable than "free" t2.micro that constantly crashes)
- After free tier benefits: stable development environment

**Cost Optimization:**
- Stop instances when not in use
- Use remove script for complete cleanup

## 🆚 Why Not Alternatives?
